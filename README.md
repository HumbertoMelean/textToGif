# Speed Reader GIF Generator

The Speed Reader GIF Generator is a web application that enables users to convert text into a speed reading GIF. Users can set a custom reading speed in words per minute (WPM) to display each word in the text as if it were in a speed reader. This tool is ideal for embedding into blogs and articles, helping readers consume content quickly without needing an external speed reader app.
